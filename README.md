# Sentence Simplification
This project aims to identify english sentences with more than two clauses and mark the clause boundaries. Additionally, breaking the complex/compound sentences into multiple simple sentences incorporating non-destructive simplification.
Following a rule-based method for this purpose, we primarily use constituency-based parse tree.
